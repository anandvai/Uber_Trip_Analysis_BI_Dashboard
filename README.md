- **Drop Off Time** â€“ Timestamp of when the trip ended
- **passenger_count** â€“ Number of passengers in the trip
- **trip_distance** â€“ Distance covered in the trip
- **PULocationID** â€“ Pickup location ID
- **DOLocationID** â€“ Drop-off location ID
- **fare_amount** â€“ Base fare charged for the trip
- **Surge Fee** â€“ Additional charges applied during high demand
- **Vehicle** â€“ Type of vehicle used for the trip
- **Payment_type** â€“ Mode of payment (Card, Cash, Wallet, etc.)

### Location Table (3 Columns):

## Business Requirements

### Uber Trip Analysis

The objective of this project is to analyze Uber trip data using Power BI and extract meaningful insights for decision-making. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders optimize ride efficiency, enhance pricing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Bookings** â€“ Count of trips booked over a given period.
- **Total Booking Value** â€“ Total revenue generated from all trips.
- **Average Booking Value** â€“ Average revenue per trip.
- **Total Trip Distance** â€“ Total distance covered by all trips.
- **Average Trip Distance** â€“ Average distance per trip.
- **Average Trip Time** â€“ Average duration of trips.

## Expected Outcomes

âœ” Identify trends in ride bookings and revenue generation.  
âœ” Analyze trip efficiency based on distance and duration.  
âœ” Compare booking values and trip patterns across different time periods.  
âœ” Provide insights to optimize pricing models and improve customer experience.  

# Dashboard 1: Overview Analysis

## Visualizations & Insights

### Measure Selector

A disconnected table is used to create a dynamic measure selector for:
- **Total Bookings**
- **Total Booking Value**
- **Total Trip Distance**

Allows users to switch between key metrics interactively.

### Bookings Analysis by Payment Type
Breakdown of bookings based on payment methods (Card, Cash, Wallet, etc.)

### Trip Type Analysis (Day/Night)
Identifies variations in bookings based on time of the day.

### Vehicle Type Analysis
Grid table displaying KPIs (**Total Bookings, Total Booking Value, Avg Booking Value, Total Trip Distance**) across different vehicle types.  
Conditional formatting applied for better insights.

### Total Bookings by Day
Detects daily booking trends to identify peak and off-peak periods.  
Helps understand the impact of external factors (holidays, events, weather) on demand.

### Location Analysis
- **Most Frequent Pickup & Drop-off Points** â€“ Identifies common starting and ending locations for trips. Optimizes driver availability and dynamic pricing.
- **Farthest Trip Analysis** â€“ Determines the longest trip based on distance traveled. Useful for analyzing outlier trips and fare optimization.
- **Total Bookings by Location (Top 5)** â€“ Identifies high-demand areas for better resource allocation.
- **Most Preferred Vehicle for Pickup Locations** â€“ Determines vehicle type preferences at various pickup points.

### Additional Features
- **Dynamic Title** â€“ Updates chart titles based on selected measure.
- **Slicers** â€“ Interactive filters for Date, City, etc.
- **Tooltips** â€“ Shows additional details like Average Booking Value or Trip Distance.
- **Bookmarks** â€“ Includes:
  - "Data Details" Bookmark: Displays key metric definitions and dataset overview.
  - "Clear Filters" Button: Resets all selections instantly.
  - "Download Data" Button: Exports raw data to CSV/Excel using Power Automate.

# Dashboard 2: Time Analysis

## Objective
Understanding trip demand patterns based on time intervals to optimize operations and pricing.

## Visualizations

### Measure Selector
Allows selection of:
- **Total Bookings**
- **Total Booking Value**
- **Total Trip Distance**

Updates all charts dynamically.

### Pickup Time Analysis (10-Minute Intervals)
Area chart groups trip bookings into 10-minute intervals.  
Identifies peak and off-peak demand periods.

### Day-wise Trends
Line chart shows booking trends across Monday to Sunday.  
Helps compare weekday vs. weekend demand.

### Hour & Day Heatmap
- **Rows:** Hours of the Day (0â€“23)  
- **Columns:** Days of the Week (Mon-Sun)  
- **Values:** Selected KPI (e.g., Total Bookings)  

Highlights peak demand hours.
